# A Toolkit for California Health Data Ambassadors
### A statewide pilot project funded by the California HealthCare Foundationâ€™s Free the Data Initiative

This toolkit serves as a guide and resource for you to pursue the following goals as a Health Data Ambassador:
1. Identify members within your local health community that could benefit from simpler, more open access to CHHS data.
2. Work with your community to prioritize local needs that could be addressed by CHHS data.
3. Provide on-going feedback that you receive from the community with CHHS.
4. Develop applications that address a real-world community need and demonstrate the value of open data.
